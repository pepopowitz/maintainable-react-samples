# Maintainable React Samples

This project contains samples for my talk on Pragmatic Patterns For Maintainable React apps. The slides for the talk can be found [here](http://steven-j-hicks-speaking.netlify.com/maintainable-react).

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.



## TODO

* crappy for-loop doing things a map/filter/reduce could do
* better map/filter/reduce

* propTypes & defaultProps - bolt-ons, the old way
* propTypes & defaultProps - class fields, the new way

* this.state = {} in ctor - the old way
* state = {} as class field - the new way

* nested promises
* async/await

* a complex problem that can be broken down into deferred solutions
  (to prove out TDD/procrastination)

* redux example of checking a box
* react state checking a box
* example of lifting up react state
* example of redux for app state

* code as shirts + shirts
* code as outfits

* reducer, action, action-creator as shirts + shirts
* reducer, action, action-creator as outfits
  exports reducer and action-creators
  show consumption of it also?

* prettier fixing my code
